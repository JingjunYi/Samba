# [NeurIPS 2024] Samba: Severity-aware Recurrent Modeling for Cross-domain Medical Image Grading

This is the official implementation of our work entitled as ```Samba: Severity-aware Recurrent Modeling for Cross-domain Medical Image Grading```, which has been accepted by ```NeurIPS 2024```.

## Environment Configuration

Please refer to the ```requirements.txt``` file in this project.

## Training

to be updated soon.

## Inference

to be updated soon.

# Acknowledgement

The development of ```Samba``` largely relies on the source code from ```VMamba```, with the code link [https://github.com/MzeroMiko/VMamba]. We sincerely appreciate the authors for advancing ```Selective State Space Model``` (Mamba) to the visual domain.
